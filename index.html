<p>Rhythms is an open source app developed for Laravel 4, to simplify the setup and maintenance of your Laravel based projects. Our aim is to provide a one click solution to install and update your development files.</p>

<p>However rhythms for Laravel is not endorsed by or associated with Laravel and is in its infancy. There’s still a lot of room for improvement and we are open for suggestions and comments. </p>

<p>Like Laravel rhythms is completely free and simple, and following this documentation should give you a hassle free experience.</p>

<p>Rhythms is a standalone app and does not require an installation or configuration. To create perfect tunes, rhythms depend on a few third party instruments that web developers or Laravel developers would most probably be familiar with.</p>

<p>You can download the app <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/r4l/files/rhythms.exe/download">here</a></p>

<p>Currently rhythms only supports windows based systems and requires .net framework 4 client version. The .net framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft, and is usually already installed on updated systems.</p>

<ul>
<li>To install please visit <a href="http://microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851">http://microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851</a>
</li>
</ul><p>Install apache, if not already installed. While most cross-platform web servers should support rhythms, we have only vigorously tested rhythms on XAMPP, with apache 2 on 64 bit windows 8 systems.</p>

<ul>
<li>For more information about XAMPP please visit <a href="http://apachefriends.org">http://apachefriends.org</a>
</li>
</ul><p>If you haven’t already installed composer, you can do so by visiting their official website to get the latest version. Composer is a tool for dependency and package management in PHP. It allows you to declare the dependent libraries your projects need and it will install them in your projects for you.</p>

<ul>
<li>To download and install composer please visit <a href="http://getcomposer.org">http://getcomposer.org</a>
</li>
</ul><p>Once you have composer on your system you should install GIT. It will help you update your Laravel installations, is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</p>

<ul>
<li>To download and install GIT please visit <a href="http://git-scm.com/download">http://git-scm.com/download</a>
</li>
</ul><p>Further instructions on these instruments and how to install them are readily available on the web.</p>

<p>Once you’ve installed all the required tools, you’re all set to begin installing Laravel with the help of rhythms. Please do note that Laravel can be used and installed without rhythms by using composer and GIT alone. Rhythms is only a helping hand to guide you in your pursuit of the perfect melody.</p>

<p>To run rhythms just execute the rhythms.exe file. Remember that rhythms should only be run as an administrator. To do so, right-click the rhythms icon and select run as administrator.</p>

<p><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/352ewjp/5" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>Rhythms is a single instance app and only one window of it can be opened at any given time. This is to prevent hiccups and false tunes. When you run rhythms you should get a clean rhythms window with the sidebar open stating that there are no errors. Below is what your window should look like.</p>

<p>Once you click compose, rhythms will begin downloading and installing the latest version of Laravel. The melody duration depends on your internet speed, and may take up to 15 minutes. While the project is being composed, you will be given a composing screen with progress details like the one shown below.</p>

<p>You can now lay back on a cloud and enjoy a nice harp lesson……or you could get yourself a nice cup of coffee.</p>

<p><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/2nvwnci/5" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>When rhythms complete the installation, you can move on to adding extra packages to your project. However this is optional and if no errors are presented you can exit the app and begin using your new Laravel installation.</p>

<p>But if you are indeed interested in using more than just the brass and the strings of Laravel you can go ahead and add some repos. The sidebar will now contain the Packagist website. Here you can search for a package and click on the piece of JSON code inside the package details to add it to your list of instruments.</p>

<p>When you’re done adding, click load instruments, to continue.</p>

<p><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/245hnh2/5" alt="Screenshot"></p>

<p>The crescendo brings the installation to an elegant ending. Your project is now installed with more instruments and you will be presented with a screen asking you if you would like to create another project. To update and maintain your projects use the sidebar. Select a project using the sidebar and click update. 
It is now safe to exit the app, if there are no errors. To exit, click the small x in the top right corner.</p>
